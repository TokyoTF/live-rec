## ❓ Why MKV?

> [!TIP]
> We use **MKV** as the default format because it is more resilient. If a recording is interrupted or a segment gets corrupted, the rest of the file remains playable. In contrast, MP4 files often become completely unreadable if not finalized correctly.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with `config.json` (located at `Documents/live-rec/config.json`):

1. Backup your current `reclist`.
2. Delete the `config.json` file.
3. Restart the app to generate a fresh configuration.
4. Restore your `reclist` into the new file.
